  This repository have instructions to run the program greasy in a HPC enviroment using SLURM. This example is generic but intended to be usefull for Ibex users.

  
Greasy is a very usefull and simple tool to run your task in parallel. This is a tool developed by the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC). Here I'm just providing an example of the usage.
